In register storage class you can not used & because it does not have any memory location.
You can not initialize extern variables.
You can also create a function as extern.
You can't have a pointer pointing to register variable.
You can also declare a function inside main().
You can't declare array of zero or negetive size.
As 1D array is stored in linear row form, 2D arrays can be saved by two methods: Row Major, Collumn Major.
Nested function is supported in C.
Static variables have internal linkage.
In caser of extern variable if prior linkage in visible that the later linkage is same as prior linkage.
If a translation unit have a same identifier with both internal and external linkage then the behaviour of code is undefined.
