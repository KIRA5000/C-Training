In structure there is a concept of structure object padding.
This concept is used by compiler to increase the fetching speed of the data type by simply compromising space complexity.
What compiler does here is that compiler while fetching data from structure fetches data based on the word size provided by the compiler
that is 4 byte for 32-bit processor and 8byte for 64-bit processor.

That means in below example:
struct demo
{
int i;
char ch;
}dobj;

char has been provided 4 bytes rather than one in which 3 bytes have been padded and therefore is not accessible.
ie sizeof(demo)-->8

So to minimize the space complexity damage it is a good practice that smaller data types should be written above larger data types.

Padding can also be reduced by another concept:#pragma pack(a)<------(a: 1,2,4,8,16)

Any other value for a will not execute #pragma pack.

Pragma and __attribute__(()) are compiler dependent operators which are used to turn on or turn off some features which are defined in C.

#pragma startup and exit doesn't work in gcc so need to use __attribute__((constructor)) and __attribute__(destructor)) instead.

#pragma warn -rvl (for return value), -par (for parameter), -rch (for unreachable code) //gcc doesn't display warning for these anyway.
