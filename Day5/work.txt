Only .exe files are stored in the harddisk.

The code is stored in RAM:
1. cmd argument: Command line arguments are stored here.
2. stack: Variables,addresses are stored here.
3. potential gap: A gap in case dat or stack size increases based on program.
4. data(BSS/non BSS): All global and extern variables are stored here. BSS stands for Block Static with Symbol. BSS is for uninitialized. non-BSS is for initialized.
5. heap: Heap stores all the variable that are dynamically memory allocated.
6. text: Text stores the code.

In C you can also declare functions as static, by default they can be accesed from any where, by making them static they can only be accessed by that file only.
